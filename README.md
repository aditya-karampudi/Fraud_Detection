## Credit_card_fraud
Fraud losses incurred by banks and merchants on all credit, debit, and pre-paid general purpose and private label payment cards issued globally hit $21.84 billion (bn) in 2015, with the United States (US) accounting for almost two-fifths (38.7%) of the total at $8.45bn. But by 2020 it could surpass $12bn. So it is necessary to use ML and DL to find out fraud transactions and effectively track them.

This repo is the code and analysis done by joparga3 for the kaggle competition Credit card fraud detection. The dataset is imbalanced and it is really challenging to understand and analyse such dataset. I have choosen this dataset to learn how to train algorithm with extreme parameter tuning using K-fold validation. This code has given me good knowledge on coding. This repo is explanation how joparga3 has approached to problem and coded. 

### Packages needed:
    pandas-  data importing and cleaning and training algorithm
    matplotlib -  visualization
    numpy - data splitting and manipulation
